entire server crashes. This can happen when a client (browser) is closed while
the handler is sending it data.
fCLOSEDfffflelanthranfWed Mar 18 21:34:23 2020fFixed by using signal() to ignore the pipe signals. This causes the pipe error
to be returned as an error to the wirte call where it is correctly handled as
an error.

being shown. This is not the desired behaviour - the server should realise
that **even without** the trailing '/' there is a directory involved and
should invoke the directory handler.

Maybe make this change in the directory handler so that it first stats the
index.html file (if it exists).
