 Specifying a directory without the trailing '/' results in a directory index
being shown. This is not the desired behaviour - the server should realise
that **even without** the trailing '/' there is a directory involved and
should invoke the directory handler.

Maybe make this change in the directory handler so that it first stats the
index.html file (if it exists).
